# CORE Tokens
#
# These tokens should be platform-agnostic.
#
# Atomic vs Semantic tokens
#
# If Atomic tokens are "choices", then Semantic tokens are "decisions".
#
# - Atomic tokens are raw values that should rarely be used outside of a theme.
# - Atomic tokens CAN change without notice.
#
# - Semantic tokens should rarely contain raw values and should reference an
#   atomic token to resolve its value.
# - Semantic tokens should rarely change, so that end-user consumption remains
#   as consistent and stable as long as possible.


# TODO: Should tokens be defined per-platform or mixed?
#   - There are universal atomics, but there are also atomics that won't apply
#     to every platform.  So we might try defining tokens at every level (core,
#     platform, technology, and project)

# Modular Scale (atomic)
#
# Unitless to simplify calculations and to remain platform-agnostic.
# However, values may be treated as if they were CSS pixels (independent of
# device screen pixel density).
