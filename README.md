# Ooey

(i.e., letter phoenetic pronunciation of "UI")

A multi-platform, multi-library, forward-thinking, design system.

## Install
TBD...


## Supported Browsers
(TODO: move to `packages/web-core/README.md`)

Ooey is designed to work on evergreen browsers only (IE not supported).

This is because Ooey is built using the following technologies:

* [ECMAScript Modules (ESM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
* [ECMAScript 2015 / ES6](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)
* [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
